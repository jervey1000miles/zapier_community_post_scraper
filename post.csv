Now, my HTML needs to have the corresponding url for each order.How do I extract that from the New Order Data and include it in the email body?The temporary workaround that I have come up with is that instead of sending them to the Product page, I am sending them to a survey form wherein they will fill up their review and we later extract that to our review app on the website.Any inputs regarding this will be much appreciated.",

Very new to Zapier but I run a company where we need to collect a lot of receipts and other misc docs from employees that live in other cities that we don’t interface with often. There is a language barrier so we thought texting a receipt to a gmail account where it automatically transfers the doc to the company’s shared OneDrive would be ideal. In testing it, it seems to work great in terms of getting the picture to onedrive, but ideally we would love to know who sent the document without having to log into gmail. If I select customize file - attachment (exists but not shown) and leave the next field file name only blank - I have no issue with getting the file in the folder. It just renames to whatever the pic name is within their phone. If I select File Name - From Email, it doesn’t save the picture, it just saves the contact info as a MS-DOS application that won’t even open on my PC.

Maybe someone here has run into this issue and has a suggested solution. https://community.airtable.com/t/using-form-responses-to-create-junction-table-to-calculate-assembly-cost/33523 The most basic description of the issue is that forms return data horizontally (one row, many columns), when performing calculations, you want to work with data vertically (many rows, some columns), and there is no transpose function within Airtable to my knowledge.Currently, we have a manual work around by copy/paste a single row or export/import csv for entire table from our form data table into Google sheets, then transpose, then re-copy and paste back data into our BOM table.  I would like to be able to automate this but haven’t been successful yet.  The automation steps seem to want to create a single record/single row.  I haven’t fully explored using a multi-step zap, but with 50+ items chosen on the form, the concept of a 50-step zap to do what a simple copy/paste does manually seems inefficient even if it is automated.

Background:I am using Monday as a CRM for lead management. Often the best form of communication is email and SMS messages. Monday has an update section for every item. Currently all emails 2 and from are automated and placed in the update column with integrations. For SMS I need to copy and paste the text messages in manually each time.  What I am trying to do:1- When Text comes in or goes out, it is forwarded in email format to a Zapier email address(done)2- Zapier parses the info from the text so that it can pick up the phone number, incoming/outgoing status and the text from the message. (done)3- Query the monday.com api to return any items with a matching number in the phone number column to the number picked up earlier (struggling)4- Put the message from the text in the update section from the item/s found from the previous step. (need to do previous step first, will probably struggle)  How I am trying to achieve it:Using a POST webhook with JSON string. Please note for monday POST is the only type of webhook to use with their v2 api. The JSON part of it will decide if you are trying to give or take info.  Working to find item from phone number on 1 board. I am trying to find the item using the phone number from all boards or 4 boards specifically. I have been told by Monday.com that you can’t do a single call for more than 1 board with this type of query. I need to do 4 separate queries. When I press the “+” to add another row it comes up with errors after trying to add more calls. Saying the formatting isn’t acceptable.  Any expertise or help on this will be much appreciated. I know it is quite specific and long winded so thank you for at least reading this far if you have. Open to other ideas, doesn’t just have to be webhooks.  Looking forward to hearing back.

I have an Airtable base with two tables: Requirements and Clients. The Requirements table receives orders, even from Contacts who are not in our Client list yet. Once they put in a Requirement, we use Zap to create a new entry for them in the Client table.    Since the Client entries are made dynamically, we cannot pre-populate the Client table. As a result, all the requirements that come through require Zap to be linked from the Requirements table to the Clients table. Now the issue is that even thoguh the Requirements column on the clients table is a field that allows linking to multiple data entries, Zap does not update the Requirements column on the clients table with multiple fields. It always replaces the old Requirement links/entries associated with any Client, with the Requirement ID for a new Requirement made by the client.   I want the field to hold multiple entries for the older ones, on the basis of their business name and email. The Zap filter is working fine. I just need some advice as to how I can get Zap to update the Airtable field with multiple values instead of replacing the old values. ",

I have several ZAPs that connect webhooks to CRMs and ticketing systems for clients. These are simple API integrations and have no error checking. This was done on purpose. When a ZAP fails, it shows in the ZAP history. I would like to use another ZAP to monitor those and should one be stopped with an error, then notify either me or my client with the payload from the webhook that triggered it.  The solution given to us three months ago does not give us what we are looking for. Zapier manager does “catch” errors, but …..we need access to the payload being delivered. Remember, a “webhook” always returns a success and we are using the webhook zap to simply things for our developers.  Per the Zapier Manager, this should trigger when an account encounters an error... … and it does. Below is the example data:  The issue is that there is nothing we can send to our client. The “task_history_link” is to our Zap task history and our target (client) would not have access to that. It is the same with the zap_link. When the Zap fails, we email the error to our ticketing system and to the client. Once an error occurs and we are notified, we can go into the Task History and find it. These are great for us to troubleshoot, but not for our client to figure out what lead (CRM) or Ticket (ServiceNow) might have failed.We got two notifications yesterday. Going to the Task History on our account, I found them: When I click on the stopped task, I can see the data out. That has the essential information that we would like to send to our client, so that they could process it manually. Why? Because I cannot edit the payload and fix the error and retry it and it would just fail again (in this case, it was failing because the CRM was expecting an email address and it was malformed). This is the outbound task payload, but does not appear to be accessible by “Zapier Manager” (for either “New Zap Error” or “Zap Turned Off”).Is there a tool/zap that will do this, or will we have to look at writing our own (using CLI?) ?

When you add a webinar registration with a dynamic webinar ID you do not have the option to add a last name and therefore it fails. I tested the dynamic id for adding a meeting registrant and it works fine. The bug is only isolated to the webinar registrant.I know this is a know issue, but like I said before it has worked everyday for 5 months until today. I have tried every trick that people have offered up including all the tricks around the last name required, completing the zap with an extra unknown field, etc. Are there any new ideas to fix this? If I don’t use a dynamic field for the webinar id, it works great but that does me no good since we have people registering for up to 20 different webinars at the same time.",
